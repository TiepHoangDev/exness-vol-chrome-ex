# Privacy Policy for Trade Stats & Tools for Exness Web

**Last updated:** November 24, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how "Trade Stats & Tools for Exness Web" (the "Extension") handles your data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your trading data remains secure.

## 1. Data Collection and Use

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit your personal data.**

The Extension operates entirely on the client-side (within your browser). It functions as follows:

*   **Trading Data:** The Extension reads trading data (open positions, volume, prices) directly from the Exness WebTerminal API using your active browser session. This data is processed locally in your computer's memory (RAM) solely to calculate statistics like "Break-even Price" and "Total Volume". This data is never sent to any third-party server.
*   **Authentication:** The Extension reads the `JWT` authentication cookie from `exness.com` solely to authorize requests to the trading server (`eccweb.mobi`). We do not store, log, or share this token.

## 2. Permissions

The Extension requires specific permissions to function:

*   **Cookies:** Used strictly to retrieve the session token required to communicate with the Exness trading API on your behalf.
*   **Storage:** Used locally to save your user interface preferences (e.g., the X/Y coordinates of the floating dashboard) so the panel stays in place when you reload the page. We do not store personal information here.
*   **Host Permissions:** Access to `exness.com` and `eccweb.mobi` is required to inject the dashboard overlay and fetch real-time trading data.

## 3. Third-Party Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or transfer your data to outside parties. The Extension communicates directly between your browser and the official Exness trading servers. No intermediate servers are used.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
